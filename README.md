Status:
====
Does not really work yet

Goal:
====

* Write Set as a commandline (or possibly server / api) game, for fun and just because
* Use ruby and possibly rails, for practice with the ecosystem tooling. 
* Make it a gem, because why the heck not

Disclaimers:
====

* My commit style on this project is very fragmented because I steal ten minutes here and there (at lunch, on a plane, in the morning before work) to write a test and make it pass (or not) ... on a production / team project, I would break fewer things and make more cohesive (and better-described) commits.
